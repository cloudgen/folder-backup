**folder-backup** packs a folder you name into a dated gzip archive under `/var/backup/folder-backup/`, checks the file count and size, and can put that folder back onto the hard-disk projects tree.

| You (your own login) | Admin / already root | Not this |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Install to `~/.local/bin`, write a grant you can read, submit it, then run backup/restore after an admin has installed the grant | Install into `/usr/local/bin` and install the sudoers fragment | A normal login does not write `/etc`. A terminal with no command does not download. |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| Pipe install, numbered boards, backup/restore, grant draft, local `install`, self-update | A terminal with no command that downloads |
| Admin-installed narrow grant for `/var/backup` | A normal login writing `/etc` |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Install from the internet | No root. Places the program in `~/.local/bin` (mode `0700`). | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/folder-backup/main/src/folder-backup \| sh` |
| Open the boards | On a real terminal, a bare run shows client-side, self-management, and Exit. | `folder-backup` |
| Write a grant you can read | JSON under your config folder. An admin still installs it. | `folder-backup generate-sudoer-request` |
| Pack a folder after the grant exists | Copies the archive into `/var/backup/folder-backup/`. | `folder-backup backup /path/to/project` |

## Features

- **Install for yourself**: copy this program into `~/.local/bin` (`install`); remove it (`uninstall`); ask where it lives (`where-is-me`)
- **Pipe install**: `curl … \| sh` places this program (`self-install`). A checkout file copies; a pipe downloads. Your login gets mode `0700`. Root gets `/usr/local/bin` at mode `0755`. `version-check` and `self-update` use the same GitHub raw URL. `self-uninstall` removes that placed binary. A terminal with no command does not do this.
- **Scratch stays with this login and this run**: temporary files live in a private folder named for you and this process. `about` prints the folder in use, the preferred folder, and the fallbacks. A folder that cannot be used is skipped quietly. Notes that must survive a reboot stay in `~/.local/folder-backup`
- **Numbered boards**: on a real terminal, a bare `folder-backup` (or `menu` / `main`) shows client-side, self-management, and Exit. Server-side stays hidden. **1** then **11** packs a folder. **1** then **17** opens grant and drafts (submit and remove). **8** opens install, version, and update. A finished command returns to the front. **0** steps back.
- **Backup a folder**: pack it to a dated gzip under `/var/backup/folder-backup/`, check counts, then keep at most **5** same-day and **30** total copies per project name
- **Restore**: put an archive back onto the hard-disk projects tree (or a path you name)
- **Restore dest guard**: allow `/etc/<your-login>`; refuse `/etc/passwd` and other system paths
- **Grant you can read**: write JSON (`generate-sudoer-request`); hand it to the approval queue (`submit-sudoer-request`) without writing `/etc`
- **Admin grant install**: print a sudoers draft and an admin script; an admin copies it to `/etc/sudoers.d/`
- **Fail closed**: missing source, unauthorized deposit, verify mismatch, non-empty restore without `--force`
- **Scratch stays with this login and this run**: temporary files live in a private folder named for you and this process. `about` prints the folder in use, the preferred folder, and the fallbacks. A folder that cannot be used is skipped quietly. Notes that must survive a reboot stay in `~/.local/folder-backup`

## Quick Installation

### Online (this is the install)

**Your own login (no root):**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/folder-backup/main/src/folder-backup | sh
```

That one line places `~/.local/bin/folder-backup` (mode `0700`). It does not print help. A second run says the program is already installed.

**Already a root login.** Same one-liner as root. The file lands in `/usr/local/bin/folder-backup` (mode `0755`):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/folder-backup/main/src/folder-backup | sh
```

Then:

```sh
folder-backup version
```

**From a checkout** (copy this file, mode `0755`, no download):

```sh
sh src/folder-backup install
```

`sh src/folder-backup` with no command, off a terminal, is the other place: it copies this file the way `self-install` does (mode `0700` for your login). On a terminal that same bare run opens the boards and does not copy.

**Local copy detail (your own login, no root needed):**

```sh
# From this repository checkout
sh src/folder-backup install
# or force refresh after updates
sh src/folder-backup install --force

# Ensure ~/.local/bin is on PATH, then:
folder-backup version
```

**Global (preferred before durable sudoers / production elevation):**

```sh
sudo sh src/folder-backup install
# or: folder-backup install --global   # needs write access to /usr/local/bin
# Managed binary mode is always 0755 so every user can run the installed program.
# If an older install left 0711 (rwx--x--x), re-run: sudo sh src/folder-backup install
```

**Sudoers (required for non-root deposit / restore of root-owned archives):**

```sh
# Prefer: refresh project-sudoers-file + write admin script under /dev/shm
# Production (global install present):
folder-backup print-sudoers-install-script
# Test mode only (local/unmanaged):
folder-backup print-sudoers-install-script --allow-test-local

# Admin (account with sudo rights) — handoff script (path printed by CLI):
sudo sh /dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh install   # visudo + install 0440
sudo sh /dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh replace   # remove old then install
sudo sh /dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh uninstall # leave test elevation
sudo sh /dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh status

# Manual equivalent still valid (paths are per-user — multi-user safe):
# sudo visudo -c -f ~/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>
# sudo install -m 0440 ~/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user> /etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>
```

**Security note:** Local `~/.local/bin` install is **not** production-secure for host elevation — the user can change the binary and stage trees. Prefer global install for any host that keeps `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>`. Multi-user hosts get **one fragment file per user** (no shared overwrite). See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

**Named channel verbs.** `self-install` places this program the same way the one-liner above does (your login: `~/.local/bin/folder-backup`, mode `0700`; root: `/usr/local/bin/folder-backup`, mode `0755`). `version-check`, `self-update`, and `self-uninstall` use that channel. Local `install` is a different verb: it copies the file you are running (mode `0755`) and does not download.

```sh
folder-backup self-install
folder-backup version-check
```

**Source repository:** [cloudgen/folder-backup](https://github.com/cloudgen/folder-backup)  
Config identity: `REPO_USER=cloudgen`, `REPO_NAME=folder-backup`. The default channel is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/folder-backup/main/src/folder-backup`. Override `SCRIPT_URL` or `REPO_*` before those verbs if you use a fork. An empty `SCRIPT_URL` does not turn the channel off (`:=` fills it). Set a non-empty unreachable URL when you need the verbs to fail closed offline.

**Automatic SHA-256 check** (download path of `self-install` and `self-update` when `CHECKSUM` is unset). The program fetches the companion next to the script:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/folder-backup/main/src/folder-backup.sha256`

The file in this repository is `src/folder-backup.sha256` (one line, 64 hex digits). A `sha256sum` line is also accepted; the first field is the digest.

| Outcome | What happens |
|---------|----------------|
| **Match** | HTTP 200 and the digest equals the downloaded file. Install continues. Human output shows the companion link, the expected value, the actual value, and `Automatic checksum result: PASS`. |
| **Mismatch** | The companion arrived and the digest does not match (or is empty). Install stops. The new file is not placed. |
| **Missing** | The companion is not HTTP 200. Human output warns and the install continues without that check. |

`CHECKSUM` set to a 64-hex digest is a strict pin for that one run: a match installs, a mismatch stops. It is not listed in `help` or `about`. A pin taken from the same URL is the same trust as the automatic companion: the bytes match each other. It is not a separate signature. Local `install` does not download and does not use this check.

After install, on a terminal:

Choose a number, or type a command name. **1** opens this login’s folders. **17** opens grant and drafts: queue a JSON grant, or remove the local draft. `generate-sudoer-request`, `print-sudoers`, and `print-sudoers-install-script` stay typed commands. **8** opens install, version, and update. **0** steps back. **9** leaves. A finished command shows the front board again. `folder-backup sudoers` is not a command. In a script or pipe, `folder-backup` with no arguments places this program. Naming `menu` or `self-management` in a script prints help.

## Usage

```sh
folder-backup                               # TTY numbered boards; a pipe places this program
folder-backup help
folder-backup menu                          # same boards on a TTY; a script prints help
folder-backup about
folder-backup --json about

folder-backup backup /path/to/project
folder-backup restore project-name              # → hard-disk PROJECTS_ROOT/project-name
folder-backup restore project-name --disk       # explicit hard-disk
folder-backup restore project-name --ram        # → /dev/shm/project-name
folder-backup restore NAME-YYYYMMDD-N.tar.gz /explicit/dest
folder-backup restore project-name --force      # allow non-empty dest

folder-backup print-sudoers
folder-backup generate-sudoer-request   # local verified JSON (review this file)
folder-backup submit-sudoer-request     # JSON request into /var/sudoer-cli/sudoer-request (if present)
folder-backup submit-sudoer-request ~/.config/folder-backup/sudoer-request-$(id -un).json
folder-backup uninstall --force
```
