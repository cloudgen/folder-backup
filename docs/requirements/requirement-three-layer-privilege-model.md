**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-three-layer-privilege-model.md  
**Status**: Active (Version 1.7.0)  
**Area**: architecture  
**Key**: `requirement-three-layer-privilege-model`  
**Philosophy**: CIAO **v2.10.2** / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered / Over-protect)

## 1. Purpose

This requirement is the **project Single Source of Truth** for the **three-layer privilege model** as applied to **folder-backup**: which operations run as the invoking user, which use **narrow elevated sudo**, and what is out of scope.

It is also the **product law SSOT for working with sudoers fragment files**: how the CLI **emits** a draft, how an **admin** validates and installs under `/etc/sudoers.d/`, how **`submit-sudoer-request`** hands a grant to sibling **sudoer-cli** so a **JSON request** lands in the **public inbound**, how **runtime deposit** uses allowlisted `sudo -n`, and how **fail-closed** behaves when elevation is missing.

**JSON sudoer file body** (command identity, schema, samples) is **not** owned here — it is **`requirement-sudoer-json-file`**. That peer **MUST** grant only `{{PRJ_NAME}}` (`folder-backup`); OS-tool commands (`cp`, `mkdir`, …) are forbidden there.

Domain backup semantics (naming, tar, pillars) live in `requirement-domain-folder-backup.md`. Agent procedure for security-gated create is **`SK-CREATE-SUDOERS-FILE`** (not product-source authority).

## 2. Core Rules / Requirements (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Layer map (this product)

| Layer | Privilege | Actor | folder-backup responsibilities |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------------------------------|
| **Type 0** | Invoking user | End user / automation | Local install/uninstall, diagnostics, path report, tar.gz **create** in user staging, **print / write draft** sudoers fragment |
| **Type 1** | Elevated (controlled sudo) | root via **allowlisted** command only | `folder-backup backup` / `folder-backup restore` (grant body: `requirement-sudoer-json-file`). After elev, deposit/verify/restore run **inside** the ship unit. |
| **Type 2** | Dedicated least-privilege system user | App runtime user | **Not used** — no dedicated app user required |

### 2.2 Least-privilege rules

1. **MUST NOT** require the whole CLI to run as root for normal backup creation.  
2. **MUST** create the tar.gz archive as the invoking user in isolated staging.  
3. **MUST** elevate only for the **deposit** step (and only via allowlisted sudo).  
4. **MUST NOT** grant unrestricted shell, package install, or arbitrary `cp` across the filesystem.  
5. **MUST NOT** open unapproved network egress as part of privilege design (local-only product).  
6. **MUST NOT** treat “sudoers installed” as permission to broaden Cmnds later without a new security review.

---

### 2.3 Working with sudoers fragment files (normative)

#### 2.3.1 Roles and artifacts

| Role | May | Must not |
|------|-----|----------|
| **End user / automation** | Run `print-sudoers`; run `backup` after admin install | Write `/etc/sudoers.d/` as Type 0 |
| **CLI (Type 0)** | Emit fragment to **stdout** or a **user-writable draft path** | Silently install or rewrite `/etc/sudoers.d/*` |
| **Admin (root)** | `visudo -c`, install with mode `0440`, pre-create deposit dir ownership if needed | Install fragments that grant shell/`ALL` |
| **Agent (harness)** | Follow **`SK-CREATE-SUDOERS-FILE`** + **`CL-CREATE-SUDOERS-SECURITY`** before drafting | Auto-write `/etc`; emit without Pass review |

| Artifact | Location (this product) | Authority |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Draft fragment** | stdout **or** `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>` (or path arg to `print-sudoers`); legacy `sudoers.fragment` still recognized for remove | Type 0 write only |
| **Installed fragment** | `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` (per-user; multi-user safe). Legacy `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup` may still exist on older hosts | Admin only; mode `0440` |
| **Security review (pre-emit)** | `reviews/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-sudoers-security-folder-backup.md` (and local security checklist trail when used) | Required before **agent create** of a new draft |
| **External sudoers audit record** | `docs/whitelists/external-sudoers/records/WS-*.md` | Optional audit; no secrets |

#### 2.3.1a Install trust tiers for elevation (mandatory)

| Trust tier | Managed install | Meaning | Allowed review / emit |
|------------|-----------------|---------|------------------------|
| **`production`** | Executable **`${GLOBAL_BIN}/folder-backup`** (typically root-owned, not writable by target user) | Stronger: unprivileged user cannot rewrite the global binary | Full **Pass**; preferred for durable `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` |
| **`test_local`** | Only **`${USER_BIN}/folder-backup`** (user home) **or** no global | **Weak:** user can change local source/binary and stage content | **Pass (test only)** only; **MUST** warn TEST MODE; **MUST** plan uninstall soon |
| **Unmanaged** | Neither global nor local managed path | No managed install proof | Product emit only with explicit test allow flag; agent create **Block** without install |

**Normative:**

1. **MUST NOT** claim production-secure elevation when only a local managed binary exists.  
2. Local install remains correct for **Type 0** day-to-day use **without** sudoers.  
3. Hosts that will **keep** an installed fragment **SHOULD** use root install → global:  
   `sudo sh src/folder-backup install` or `folder-backup install --global` (as root / writable `GLOBAL_BIN`).  
4. Elevating `${USER_BIN}/folder-backup` as a Cmnd is **forbidden** for production Pass; this product’s deposit uses fixed OS tools, but residual **stage content** risk remains.  
5. Stage allowlists **MUST** bind to **per-user** product stage roots (`…/folder-backup-<user>/`), not bare `/tmp/*` or home-wide trees.

#### 2.3.2 Operator workflow (mandatory order)

| Step | Who | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | User / admin | Prefer **global** install before durable sudoers; local install OK for Type 0-only |
| 2 | User | Run `folder-backup print-sudoers` **or** `folder-backup print-sudoers <draft-path>` (test_local requires `--allow-test-local` or `ALLOW_TEST_LOCAL_SUDOERS=1`) |
| 3 | CLI (Type 0) | Emit **narrow** fragment for the **invoking user**; print trust tier + warnings |
| 4 | User | Optionally run `folder-backup print-sudoers-install-script` → admin script under `/dev/shm` (or temp) |
| 4b | User (when sudoer-cli + sudoer-adm are present) | Optionally run `folder-backup submit-sudoer-request` to hand the fragment to sudoer-cli, which **allocates a JSON request** in the **public inbound** (Type 0; no `/etc` write; no inbound `mkdir`). Approver still must approve. |
| 5 | **Admin** | Review draft (and TEST MODE banner if present); either manual `visudo -c` + `install -m 0440`, **or** `sudo sh <admin-script> install` / `replace`, **or** approve a queued request via sudoer-cli |
| 6 | **Admin** | Optional: ensure `/var/backup/folder-backup` exists with safe ownership/mode (script `install` may mkdir) |
| 7 | User | Run `folder-backup backup <dir>`; deposit uses **only** allowlisted `sudo -n` commands |
| 8 | Admin (test_local / leave elev) | **Uninstall soon**: `sudo sh <admin-script> uninstall` (or `sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>`) |

#### 2.3.3 `print-sudoers` (Type 0) product rules

1. **MUST** emit reviewable plain text suitable for `sudoers(5)` (no passwords, tokens, or private keys).  
2. **MUST NOT** write `/etc/sudoers.d/` or any path under `/etc` from the unprivileged CLI path.  
3. **MUST** target the **invoking user** in User specification lines (product default: current user).  
4. **MUST** document short **admin steps** in human output: `visudo -c`, install mode `0440`, destination name.  
5. When a **path argument** is given, **MUST** write the fragment only to that user-writable path (create parent dirs as needed) and report success via `out_*`.  
6. When **no path** is given, **MUST** print the fragment to **stdout** (plus admin hints on stderr/info channels per output SSOT).  
7. Re-running `print-sudoers` **MUST** be safe (idempotent emit; does not mutate installed `/etc` file).  
8. Fragment content **MUST** match product deposit paths and staging roots used by `fb_deposit_archive` / storage resolve (so allowlisted wildcards actually match runtime stage paths).  
9. **MUST** detect trust tier from global vs local managed install presence.  
10. When trust tier is **`test_local`** (or unmanaged): **MUST** refuse emit unless `--allow-test-local` **or** env `ALLOW_TEST_LOCAL_SUDOERS=1`; **MUST** print a **TEST MODE ONLY / uninstall soon** warning; fragment header **MUST** carry the same warning.  
11. When trust tier is **`production`**: emit without the test allow flag; header **SHOULD** note managed global path.  
12. JSON emit **MUST** include `trust_tier` (`production` \| `test_local` \| `unmanaged`) and `test_mode` (`true`/`false`).

#### 2.3.3a `print-sudoers-install-script` (Type 0) product rules

**Purpose:** Generate a handoff shell script so an account **with sudo** can install, uninstall, or replace the **project-sudoers-file** under `/etc/sudoers.d/` without the Type 0 CLI writing `/etc` itself. See term **`project-sudoers-file`**.

1. **MUST** refresh/write the **project-sudoers-file** (default `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>`) using the same trust rules as `print-sudoers` before writing the admin script.  
2. **MUST** write the admin script only under a **user-writable / volatile** path: prefer `/dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh`, else product storage/temp — **MUST NOT** write under `/etc`.  
3. **MUST NOT** itself write `/etc/sudoers.d/` or run install as a silent Type 0 side effect.  
4. Generated script **MUST** install to **`/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>`** (per-user suffix) so multi-user admin installs do not overwrite each other.  
5. Generated script **MUST** support at least:
   - `install` — `visudo -c` on draft → `install -m 0440` → per-user installed path → re-`visudo -c`  
   - `uninstall` — remove `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` only (this user’s fragment; leave other users intact)  
   - `replace` — uninstall then install (refresh host from current project-sudoers-file)  
   - `status` — report draft + installed presence; **SHOULD** note legacy shared path and other-user fragments when present  
6. Generated script **MUST** require **root** for install/uninstall/replace.  
7. Generated script **MUST NOT** embed passwords or secrets.  
8. Human output **MUST** print handoff lines: `sudo sh <script> install|uninstall|replace`.  
9. JSON **SHOULD** include `script_path`, `project_sudoers_file`, `installed_path`, `trust_tier`, `user`.

#### 2.3.3b `remove-project-sudoers` (Type 0) product rules

**Purpose:** Remove the **project-sudoers-file** draft (product-owned, user-writable). Does **not** remove the installed host fragment under `/etc/sudoers.d/`.

1. Default discovery: drafts under `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/` matching legacy `sudoers.fragment` and `sudoers.fragment-*` (default emit path is `sudoers.fragment-<user>`). Optional path argument selects one draft.  
2. **MUST NOT** remove paths under `/etc` (fail closed with hint to admin leave-elev: `sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` and/or admin script `uninstall`).  
3. When **multiple** drafts exist and no path is given:  
   - **Interactive** → **MUST** list numbered drafts and let the user choose which to remove (or cancel).  
   - **Non-interactive** / json / quiet → **MUST** fail closed and require an explicit path argument.  
4. Zero drafts → success no-op for the default path (already absent). One draft → operate on that draft.  
5. Interactive confirm unless `--force`; non-interactive/json/quiet without force → **fail closed**.  
6. On success (removed or already absent), human output **MUST probe** host elev paths (`/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>`, legacy `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup`, and other `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-*` when present):  
   - **Any present** → **MUST** warn that host elevation is still active (draft ≠ installed elev); **MUST** list present paths; **MUST** point to admin leave-elev for this user and/or `print-sudoers-install-script` then `sudo sh <script> uninstall`.  
   - **None present** → **SHOULD** state host fragment also absent (no “if any” hedge; no false elev lecture).  
7. JSON **SHOULD** include `path`, `status` (`removed` \| `already_absent`), `installed_path`, `host_fragment_present` (`0` \| `1`).

#### 2.3.3c `submit-sudoer-request` (Type 0) product rules

**Purpose:** This product is a **Type 0 sudoers-grant submitter**. When the sibling approval CLI and approver account are present, it hands a self-scoped sudoers fragment (or file) to that CLI so the CLI **allocates a JSON request file** in the sibling’s **public inbound**. This product remains Type 0: it **MUST NOT** write `/etc`, **MUST NOT** `mkdir` the production inbound, **MUST NOT** approve or reject, and **MUST NOT** choose the queued dest basename.

**Roles (this verb):**

| Role | Who | May | Must not |
|------|-----|-----|----------|
| **Submitter** | Invoking login via this CLI | Detect approval CLI + inbound; emit or pass a self-scoped fragment; invoke sibling submit | `mkdir` inbound; write `/etc`; pick dest basename; approve |
| **Allocator** | Sibling approval CLI (`{{APPROVAL_APP}}`) | Allocate `request_id`; exclusive-create JSON in inbound; `chmod 0640` | Trust a caller-supplied dest basename |
| **Approver** | Sibling LPU (`{{APPROVER}}`) | Move inbound → accepted/declined; install dest | This product’s Type 0 path |

**Inbound detect (mandatory order — first existing directory wins):**

| Priority | Candidate | When |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 1 | `SUDOER_QUEUE_INBOUND` | Set **and** is an existing directory (tests / explicit override) |
| 2 | `/var/{{APPROVAL_APP}}/{{INBOUND_BASENAME}}` | **Preferred production public inbound** (must already exist) |
| 3 | `{{approver-home}}/{{INBOUND_BASENAME}}` | F4 **view** (symlink to the public real dir) |
| 4 | Legacy only: `{{approver-home}}/sudoer-approving`, `/etc/{{APPROVER}}/sudoer-approving`, `/home/{{APPROVER}}/sudoer-approving` | Transitional hosts; **not** the preferred real dir |

Filled conventional names for this compose live in §2.5. Core rules **MUST NOT** treat a home-only `sudoer-approving` directory as the preferred real inbound.

**Normative rules:**

1. **MUST** detect the approval CLI (`{{APPROVAL_APP}}`): env `SUDOER_CLI` if executable, else global bin, else user bin, else `PATH`. Missing → fail closed with install hint.  
2. **MUST** detect the approver login (`{{APPROVER}}`, override `SUDOER_ADM_USER`) via `id`. Missing → fail closed with setup hint (`sudo {{APPROVAL_APP}} setup`).  
3. **MUST** detect inbound using the table above. Missing → fail closed with setup hint. Not writable for exclusive create → fail closed (production inbound is create-only for others: mode **3773**, no other-readdir).  
4. **MUST NOT** `mkdir` (or `mkdir -p`) the production inbound, its public parent, or any F4 view.  
5. **MUST NOT** treat this product’s deposit directory as an inbound.  
6. **MUST** report detections on `about` (human + JSON): approval CLI path or `not_found`; approver or `absent`; inbound path or `not_found`; writable flag. About inbound **SHOULD** name the preferred public path when reporting `not_found`.  
7. Default input is the same fragment `print-sudoers` would emit (same trust-tier gate). Optional file operand submits that file instead (refuse symlink / missing).  
8. **MUST** invoke the detected approval CLI `add-sudoer-request` (or `update-sudoer-request` with `--update`) with `--service` equal to this product’s `APP_NAME` and a purpose string (`--purpose` or product default). That sibling call **is** what creates the queued **JSON** file.  
9. **MUST NOT** invent or pass a dest basename for the queued file. `request_id` is whatever the sibling allocator returns.  
10. When pointing the sibling at a queue root, **MUST** use the **parent of the real public inbound** (or leave the sibling on its public default). **MUST NOT** export a home directory that still uses the legacy `sudoer-approving` child as if it were the public queue root.  
11. **MUST NOT** write `/etc/sudoers.d` or `/etc/passwd` from this verb.  
12. Product `--json` status **SHOULD** include `request_id`, `action`, `service`, `sudoer_cli`, `sudoer_adm`, `inbound`. That status object is **not** the queued request file.  
13. **Inbound fidelity:** the queued body **is** the grant the approver will install. `[OK] submitted`, the purpose string, and the emit dual are **not** substitutes. When `${inbound}/${request_id}` is readable, submit **MUST** fail closed if `commands` lost a required elev verb (`backup` / `restore`). When it is not readable (production inbound often `0640` after LPU chown), stay-honest: do **not** claim the queued file equals emit.  
14. Review / suite **MUST NOT** treat a stub `sudoer-cli` that `cp`s the input, or emit-only substring greps, as proof of sibling re-encode fidelity. Pretty-printed emit **MUST** be a fixture (INC-20260817-001).

**Queued JSON (sibling-owned shape — this product must produce input that converts):**

The queued artifact lives **in the inbound directory**. Filename grammar and closed schema are **owned by the sibling approval product**. This product **MUST** pass a self-scoped sudoers text dual (or already-valid request JSON) that the sibling can convert and queue. Worked basename + body for **this** product’s grant are in §2.5. Sibling decode/re-encode **MUST** preserve every `commands[]` object (`requirement-sudoer-json-file` §2.7a); a restore-only inbound after a backup+restore emit is a **different** grant.

#### 2.3.4 Fragment content constraints (mandatory)

Generated or admin-installed fragments for this product **MUST**:

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **User-bound** | Only the intended login (e.g. `grok-agent`) — not `ALL` users |
| **Cmnd absolute** | Absolute paths for `/usr/bin/*` and `/bin/*` variants as needed on the host |
| **Destination-bound** | Writable targets limited to `/var/backup/folder-backup/` (and `mkdir -p` of that dir only) |
| **Stage-bound** | `cp` / `install` sources limited to product staging roots for that user (`/dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>/*`, `/tmp/folder-backup-<user>/*`, and cache fallback `${HOME}/.cache/folder-backup-<user>/*` when used) |
| **No broad rights** | **MUST NOT** include `ALL=(ALL) ALL`, `NOPASSWD: ALL`, unrestricted shells (`/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash` as bare Cmnd), or unrestricted `rm`/`chmod`/`chown` over `/` |
| **NOPASSWD scope** | `NOPASSWD:` **MAY** be used **only** for the listed deposit Cmnds so non-interactive `sudo -n` deposit works; residual risk **MUST** be stated in the security review |
| **No secrets** | No passwords, API keys, or private key material in the file or comments |
| **Comments** | Header **SHOULD** state purpose, product, date/generator, and that admin must `visudo -c` |

#### 2.3.4a Example sudoers fragment (this product)

**Illustrative / normative shape** for **folder-backup** deposit after security review Pass.  
**Not** a secret. Admin **MUST** still run `visudo -c` on the host before install.  
**Source of truth for a host apply:** draft often at `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>`; installed at `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>`.  
`print-sudoers` may emit an equivalent narrow shape (combined Cmnd lines / per-user stage wildcards); both **MUST** obey §2.3.4.

```sudoers
# folder-backup — narrow deposit allowlist
# Generated: 2026-08-09
# Skill: SK-CREATE-SUDOERS-FILE
# Trust tier: production (global managed binary preferred)
# Security review: reviews/reports/2026-08-09-sudoers-security-folder-backup.md
# Target user: grok-agent (current user at generation)
# Managed binary (global): /usr/local/bin/folder-backup
# DO NOT use without: sudo visudo -c -f <this-file>
# Admin install:
#   sudo install -m 0440 <this-file> /etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-grok-agent
#
# Scope: create deposit dir + copy/install staged archives into
# /var/backup/folder-backup/ only. No full shell. No ALL.
# Residual: stage trees are user-writable; deposit is still Type 1 OS-tool copy.

# Create notation directory only
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/mkdir -p /var/backup/folder-backup
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/mkdir -p /var/backup/folder-backup

# Deposit from product staging roots (per-user storage isolation ONLY)
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cp /dev/shm/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp /dev/shm/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cp /tmp/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp /tmp/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cp /var/www/grok.dr-sense.com/.cache/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp /var/www/grok.dr-sense.com/.cache/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/

# install -m 0640 <stage-file> <dest-file>
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/install -m 0640 /dev/shm/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/*
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/install -m 0640 /tmp/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/*
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/install -m 0640 /var/www/grok.dr-sense.com/.cache/folder-backup-grok-agent/* /var/backup/folder-backup/*

# Mode on deposited archives under notation dir only
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/chmod 0640 /var/backup/folder-backup/*
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/chmod 0640 /var/backup/folder-backup/*

# Post-deposit verification (list members only; no extract)
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tar -tzf /var/backup/folder-backup/*
grok-agent ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/tar -tzf /var/backup/folder-backup/*
```

**What this example intentionally omits:** `NOPASSWD: ALL`, shell Cmnds, package managers, writes outside `/var/backup/folder-backup/`, elevation of `${USER_BIN}/folder-backup`, and elevation of arbitrary paths under `/tmp/*` (non-per-user).

**Test-local header (when tier is test_local — not production):**

```text
# WARNING: TEST MODE ONLY — local managed binary is user-rewritable.
# Uninstall this fragment soon: sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-grok-agent
# Production: sudo install global binary, re-emit print-sudoers, re-review, reinstall fragment.
```

#### 2.3.5 Admin install rules

1. Admin **MUST** validate with `visudo -c -f <file>` before install.  
2. Admin **MUST** install with restrictive mode (typically **`0440`**, owner `root:root`).  
3. Preferred installed path: **`/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>`** (per-user; multi-user safe).  
4. Product CLI and agents **MUST NOT** perform this install as a silent Type 0 side effect.  
5. After install, deposit dir **`/var/backup/folder-backup`** **SHOULD** exist (fragment may allowlisted-create it; admin may pre-create).  
6. Admin **MUST NOT** install multiple users into a single shared basename that would overwrite another user’s allowlist.

#### 2.3.6 Runtime elevation after sudoers install

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Invocation** | Non-root deposit **MUST** use `sudo -n` for allowlisted steps after passwordless fragment install |
| **Scope** | Only deposit of the **just-staged** archive into `/var/backup/folder-backup/` (plus allowlisted mkdir of that dir) |
| **Root path** | If `id -u` is 0, deposit **MAY** copy without sudo into the destination |
| **Logging** | Report success/failure via `out_*`; **never** print sudo passwords |
| **Probe honesty** | Diagnostics that report sudo status **SHOULD NOT** claim elevation is impossible solely because `sudo -n true` fails when only **narrow** Cmnds are allowlisted (prefer probing an allowlisted no-op such as allowlisted `mkdir -p` of the deposit dir) |

#### 2.3.7 Fail-closed (mandatory)

If sudo is missing, not authorized for the deposit Cmnd, or the destination cannot be written:

1. Deposit **MUST** fail with non-zero exit.  
2. Human error **MUST** point to `print-sudoers` and admin install under `/etc/sudoers.d/`.  
3. **MUST NOT** silently skip deposit and claim backup success.  
4. **MUST NOT** fall back to writing archives into `/var/backup/...` as an unprivileged user when that path is not writable.

#### 2.3.8 Agent / harness create path (when creating or revising fragments)

When an agent **creates or materially revises** a sudoers draft (beyond re-running product `print-sudoers`):

1. **MUST** follow **`SK-CREATE-SUDOERS-FILE`**.  
2. **MUST** complete **`CL-CREATE-SUDOERS-SECURITY`** with **Pass** or **Pass (test only)** before writing the draft file, including:  
   - **S11–S12** when elev Tables A/B/C (or equivalent elev whitelist) are claimed/registered — fragment ⊆ Table A; no silent widen  
   - **S13** trust tier **always** — production requires global managed binary; local-only → **Pass (test only)** only  
3. **MUST** identify **target user** (default: current user).  
4. **MUST** prove a **managed binary** install exists at global and/or local install location for `folder-backup` when the fragment elevates product-specific helpers; for OS-tool-only deposit (`mkdir`/`cp`/`install`/`chmod` with fixed trees), review **MUST** still document stage and destination bounds **and** trust-tier residual risks (stage content user-controlled).  
5. **MUST** publish a short security review under `reviews/reports/` (or filled checklist) with verdict **Pass** (production) or **Pass (test only)**.  
6. **MUST NOT** default the write target to `/etc/sudoers.d/`.  
7. **MUST NOT** mark production **Pass** for local-only managed installs.  
8. **SHOULD** update `docs/whitelists/external-sudoers/records/WS-*` when the fragment is **applied** on a host (no secrets); test_local → status **test / to-uninstall**.  
9. **SHOULD** point operators at `print-sudoers-install-script` for admin install/uninstall/replace handoff of the **project-sudoers-file** (Type 0 never writes `/etc`).

---

### 2.4 Runtime elevation contract (summary)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Invocation | `sudo -n` after passwordless fragment; non-interactive without ticket **fails closed** |
| Scope | Deposit only — not package install, not shell |
| Destination create | Allowlisted `mkdir -p /var/backup/folder-backup` only when fragment permits |
| Staging | Per-user storage under `/dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>` (preferred), else `/tmp/...`, else cache fallback — **must** match fragment wildcards |

| **Project sudoers file (draft)** | `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>` via `print-sudoers` / install-script refresh |
| **Admin install path** | `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` (per-user) |
| **Admin install script (default)** | `/dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh` via `print-sudoers-install-script` |
| **Type 2 system user** | None |
| **CLI commands** | `print-sudoers` → `fb_print_sudoers`; `print-sudoers-install-script` → `fb_print_sudoers_install_script`; `remove-project-sudoers` → `fb_remove_project_sudoers`; `submit-sudoer-request` → `fb_submit_sudoer_request`; deposit → `fb_deposit_archive` |
| **Sibling approval CLI** | `sudoer-cli` (`SUDOER_CLI` override) |
| **Sibling approver** | `sudoer-adm` (`SUDOER_ADM_USER` override); this host home `/etc/sudoer-adm` |
| **Preferred public inbound** | `/var/sudoer-cli/sudoer-request` (mode **3773**, owner `sudoer-adm:sudoer-adm`) |
| **Test public root** | `SUDOER_PUBLIC_ROOT` (default `/var/sudoer-cli`) — tests only; production create remains Type 1 setup |
| **F4 view** | `/etc/sudoer-adm/sudoer-request` → public inbound |
| **Public queue root** | `/var/sudoer-cli` (sibling default) |
| **Legacy inbound names** | `…/sudoer-approving` — last-fallback only |
| **Queued basename (sibling allocator)** | `sudoer-{{YYYYMMDD}}-folder-backup-{{user}}-add-{{n}}.json` (or `update`) |
| **Worked sample basename** | `sudoer-20260815-folder-backup-leolio-add-1.json` |
| **Worked dest after approve** | `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-leolio` |
| **Term** | `project-sudoers-file` · `sudoers-fragment` |
| **Whitelist meaning** | **Sudoers command allowlist** (narrow lines) — not server-maintenance ops registry |
| **Applied host record** | `docs/whitelists/external-sudoers/records/WS-20260803-001-folder-backup.md` |
| **Security review (example)** | `reviews/reports/2026-08-09-sudoers-security-folder-backup.md` (supersedes 2026-08-03 local-only Pass for production claims) |
| **Agent skill / checklist** | `SK-CREATE-SUDOERS-FILE` · `CL-CREATE-SUDOERS-SECURITY` (**S11–S12** elev tables when claimed; **S13** trust tier) |
| **Example fragment** | §2.3.4a (full text); live draft often `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>` |
| **Test emit gate** | `--allow-test-local` or `ALLOW_TEST_LOCAL_SUDOERS=1` when tier ≠ production |
| **Global install for production** | `sudo sh src/folder-backup install` or root/`--global` → `/usr/local/bin/folder-backup` |

**Paired text dual + queued JSON** (same grant; sibling closed schema). Live submit default hands the **JSON** grant (`fb_sudoers_json_text`). `--json` CLI status from `submit-sudoer-request` is **not** the queued file.

**JSON body SSOT:** `requirement-sudoer-json-file` — grant is **`folder-backup` only** (`backup` / `restore`). **MUST NOT** encode `mkdir` / `cp` / `tar` / `rm` / `install` / `chmod` (or deposit/stage/archive-name operands) in the queued JSON. Complete add/update samples live on that peer.

**Worked add basename:** `sudoer-20260815-folder-backup-leolio-add-1.json`  
**Worked update basename:** `sudoer-20260815-folder-backup-leolio-update-1.json`

§2.3.4a remains the **legacy text-fragment** example (OS-tool deposit). That shape is **not** a valid dual of the JSON sudoer file. When emit is updated, the text dual **MUST** match `requirement-sudoer-json-file` §2.6 (`/usr/local/bin/folder-backup backup` and `restore` only).

**Admin install script (worked shape).** Live emit is `print-sudoers-install-script` → `/dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh`. Complete verb skeleton (values filled for this product):

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# folder-backup — admin sudoers install / uninstall
# RUN: sudo sh /dev/shm/folder-backup-leolio-sudoers-admin.sh install|uninstall|replace|status
set -u
PROJECT_SUDOERS_FILE="${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-leolio"
INSTALLED_SUDOERS="/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-leolio"
die() { printf '%s\n' "ERROR: $*" >&2; exit 1; }
require_root() { [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ] || die "Must run as root"; }
cmd_install() {
    require_root
    [ -f "${PROJECT_SUDOERS_FILE}" ] || die "missing draft"
    visudo -c -f "${PROJECT_SUDOERS_FILE}" || die "visudo -c draft"
    install -m 0440 -o root -g root "${PROJECT_SUDOERS_FILE}" "${INSTALLED_SUDOERS}"
    visudo -c -f "${INSTALLED_SUDOERS}" || die "visudo -c installed"
}
cmd_uninstall() { require_root; rm -f "${INSTALLED_SUDOERS}"; }
cmd_replace() { cmd_uninstall; cmd_install; }
cmd_status() { ls -la "${INSTALLED_SUDOERS}" "${PROJECT_SUDOERS_FILE}" 2>/dev/null || true; }
case "${1:-}" in
    install) cmd_install ;;
    uninstall) cmd_uninstall ;;
    replace) cmd_replace ;;
    status) cmd_status ;;
    *) printf '%s\n' "Usage: sudo sh $0 {install|uninstall|replace|status}"; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

### 2.6 Why This Requirement Exists (CIAO)

- **Principle 9 – Three Types of Commands**  
- **Principle 10 – Least-Privilege User**  
- **Principle 1 – Caution**: Fail closed without working sudoers  
- **Principle 20 – Over-protect**: Do not collapse elevation into “just run as root” or `NOPASSWD: ALL`

---

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Narrow allowlist; admin review gate; fail closed.  
- **Intentional:** Type 0 archive vs Type 1 deposit vs Type 0 print-sudoers are separate.  
- **Anti-fragile:** Clear operator path when elevation missing; draft outside `/etc`.  
- **Over-protect:** No unrestricted sudoers templates; security review before agent create.

---

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Grant `ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` or equivalent in product-generated fragments.  
2. Auto-write `/etc/sudoers.d` from an unprivileged `print-sudoers` or agent draft path.  
3. Require root for tar creation of user-readable source trees.  
4. Introduce Type 2 system user without explicit product redesign.  
5. Use elevation for unrelated package installs or shell escapes.  
6. Store passwords or private keys in sudoers records, fragments, or requirements.  
7. Emit a **new** agent-authored fragment without **Pass** / **Pass (test only)** security review (`CL-CREATE-SUDOERS-SECURITY`).  
8. Broaden wildcards to entire `/tmp/*` or home-wide trees without redesign + review.  
9. Mark deposit success when elevated copy failed.  
10. Cite templates/skills as product-source behavioral authority (source cites **this** requirement and peers).  
11. Claim **production-secure** sudoers when only `${USER_BIN}/folder-backup` (user-rewritable) exists.  
12. Emit test_local fragments **without** TEST MODE warnings and uninstall-soon guidance.  
13. Elevate `${USER_BIN}/folder-backup` under a production Pass.  
14. `mkdir` the sibling production inbound (or its public parent) from this Type 0 CLI.  
15. Treat `/var/backup/folder-backup` (deposit) as the sudoer inbound.  
16. Probe **only** `{{approver-home}}/sudoer-approving` as the preferred real inbound when `/var/sudoer-cli/sudoer-request` is the public dest.  
17. Invent the queued JSON dest basename instead of calling the sibling allocator.  
18. Put `cp` / `mkdir` / `tar` / `rm` / `install` / `chmod` (or deposit/stage/archive-name operands) into the **JSON sudoer file** — that body is `requirement-sudoer-json-file` (`{{PRJ_NAME}}` only).  
19. Treat `[OK] Submitted` or checklist S14 Pass as proof the **inbound** `commands[]` still has `backup` and `restore`.

**Violating this rule is a critical privilege regression.**

## 5. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion |
|----|-----------|
| AC-1 | Layer map documents Type 0 vs Type 1 deposit vs no Type 2 |
| AC-2 | `print-sudoers` does not write `/etc/sudoers.d` |
| AC-3 | Deposit fails closed without working allowlisted sudo |
| AC-4 | Generated fragment is narrow (no ALL ALL / NOPASSWD: ALL) |
| AC-5 | Admin install path and `visudo -c` + mode `0440` documented in human output or product docs |
| AC-6 | Fragment stage paths align with runtime storage resolve for the user (per-user roots) |
| AC-7 | With admin-installed allowlist, non-root `backup` can deposit via `sudo -n` (host-dependent proof) |
| AC-8 | Agent create path requires security review Pass / Pass (test only) before draft write |
| AC-9 | test_local emit requires allow flag/env; warnings present in human output and fragment header (**S13**) |
| AC-10 | production tier requires global managed binary; product docs prefer global before durable sudoers (**S13**) |
| AC-11 | `print-sudoers-install-script` refreshes project-sudoers-file, writes admin script under `/dev/shm` or temp only, supports install/uninstall/replace/status, never Type 0 `/etc` write |
| AC-12 | Agent/checklist: **S11–S12** when elev tables claimed; **S13** trust tier always for production claims |
| AC-13 | `remove-project-sudoers` deletes draft only; refuses `/etc`; confirm/`--force`; probes host path and warns when elev still active |
| AC-14 | Draft default and installed path include **user suffix**; multi-user installs do not share one `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup` basename |
| AC-15 | `remove-project-sudoers` with multiple drafts lists and chooses interactively; non-interactive requires explicit path |
| AC-16 | `submit-sudoer-request` detect order: env override → public `/var/sudoer-cli/sudoer-request` → F4 `…/sudoer-request` → optional legacy `sudoer-approving` |
| AC-17 | Submit **MUST NOT** `mkdir` inbound; missing dir fails closed with `sudo sudoer-cli setup` hint |
| AC-18 | Submit creates the queued artifact **only** by invoking sibling `add-sudoer-request` / `update-sudoer-request`; dest basename is sibling-allocated JSON under the public inbound |
| AC-19 | About reports sudoer-cli / sudoer-adm / inbound (path or `not_found`) and writable flag |
| AC-20 | Queued JSON **body** obeys `requirement-sudoer-json-file` (`{{PRJ_NAME}}` only; no OS-tool commands) |
| AC-21 | When inbound `${request_id}` is readable after submit, body still contains required elev verbs; emit-only / stub-`cp` tests do not satisfy this AC |

| **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-21b** | same | have — `SUDOER_QUEUE_INBOUND` wins over public |
| **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-22 / 22b / 22c** | same | **have** — JSON sudoer file body (`requirement-sudoer-json-file`) |
| **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-22e / 22f** | same | **have** — pretty emit + inbound body fidelity (AC-21) |
