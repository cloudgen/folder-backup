Do not list `menu` / `main` as choices on their own menu.

A TTY **front** board prints category rows, not the flat work list. folder-backup is **case 2**. **`sudoers` and `language` are not live dispatcher tokens.** Front rows are **1** client-side, **6** language, **7** sudoers, **8** self-management, **9** Exit. Number **2** stays reserved (no host service). Client rows are **11** backup, **12** restore, **0** Back. Language rows are **61**–**68**. The sudoers board prints **72** submit-sudoer-request and **75** remove-project-sudoers. Test-purpose verbs stay off every numbered board; **71** / **73** / **74** stay reserved. The self board prints **81**–**87** (local `install` and channel place are both shown). Row **82** and a typed `version` on a board run `about`. Argv `version` stays `app_version`. `uninstall` and `where-is-me` stay typed. A finished leaf redisplays the front. An empty line on the front leaves. Child Back is **0**. Off a terminal, `menu` and `self-management` stop.

**Front:** client-side, sudoers, self-management, Exit. **Client:** backup, restore. **Sudoers board:** submit-sudoer-request, remove-project-sudoers. **Self board:** install, version, about, version-check, self-update, self-uninstall, self-install.

## Honesty

Dispatcher tokens on 2026-09-30: version, about, help, install, uninstall, where-is-me, self-install, version-check, self-update, self-uninstall, self-management, backup, restore, print-sudoers, print-sudoers-install-script, remove-project-sudoers, generate-sudoer-request, submit-sudoer-request, menu, main. Empty argv is **not** a token: on a real terminal it calls `app_cmd_menu`; a pipe, `--quiet`, or `--json` with no command calls `inst_self_install`. Named `menu` and `self-management` off a terminal stop. Channel verbs are live and sit on the self board (front row **8**), not as front rows. `install` is the local copy and self row **81**. This product classifies `print-sudoers`, `print-sudoers-install-script`, and `generate-sudoer-request` as **test-purpose** (off every numbered board; numbers reserved). **`sudoers` is not a dispatcher token.**
